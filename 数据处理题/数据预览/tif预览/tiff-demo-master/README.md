# Displaying TIFF with tiff.js and HTML5 Canvas

This is a demo of [tiff.js](https://github.com/seikichi/tiff.js) for decompressing and displaying a TIFF Group 4 image in a browser. The original image is 300dpi, and so cannot fit onto the screen. Therefore while the `<canvas>` is full-size, its `style` is set to 30%.

My thanks to Miles Elam (@mileselam) for explaining to me how to make a [high resolution `<canvas>`](https://twitter.com/mileselam/status/860623624989835264).

I have written up more about this demo on [Medium](https://medium.com/@thad.humphries/displaying-tiff-with-tiff-js-and-html5-canvas-dd02fe9f1a5d).
